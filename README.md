##  Project Overview

This project implements a content-based movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset
.
The system recommends movies similar to a selected title by analyzing the movie overviews (descriptions) and measuring cosine similarity between their TF-IDF representations.

 ## Key Concepts

TF-IDF (Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency):
Used to convert textual data (movie overviews) into numerical feature vectors.

Cosine Similarity:
Measures similarity between two movies based on their TF-IDF vectors.

Content-Based Filtering:
Recommends movies similar in description to a chosen movie, rather than based on user ratings.

## Tools Used

Python 

Pandas

Scikit-learn

NumPy

Jupyter Notebook / PyCharm
